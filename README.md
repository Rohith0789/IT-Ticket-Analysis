# 💼 IT Ticket Analysis – Data-Driven Performance Insights


**Goal:** Analyze IT support ticket data to uncover performance bottlenecks, improve resolution speed, and boost employee satisfaction.  
**Tools Used:** Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Correlation Analysis), Data Cleaning, Visualization, Analytical Reporting  

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The IT support department handles thousands of tickets annually, but management lacks clear visibility into agent performance, resolution efficiency, and employee satisfaction.  
This project aims to analyze the **IT support ticket management system** to:
- Evaluate **individual and team performance** of IT agents  
- Measure **efficiency of ticket resolution** and **employee satisfaction trends**  
- Identify **high and low performers** among agents  
- Pinpoint **operational bottlenecks** and areas for process improvement  

The ultimate goal is to support **data-driven staffing decisions** — including **hiring, training, or performance management** — to enhance overall service quality and productivity.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of **97,000+ IT support tickets** recorded between 2016 and 2020.  
It examines patterns in ticket volumes, agent workload, issue severity, and satisfaction scores to help management make **evidence-based process and personnel improvements**.

Key objectives:
- Track how ticket volume and resolution time vary over time  
- Identify performance gaps between agents  
- Measure the impact of new tools on efficiency and satisfaction  

---

## 🧾 Dataset Summary
- **Records:** 97,498 tickets  
- **Time Frame:** 2016–2020  
- **Key Columns:** Agent ID, Category, Priority, Severity, Resolution Time, Satisfaction Rate, Phase (Before/After Tool)  
- **Data Source:** Internal IT Ticket Management System  

**Data Preparation:**
- Fixed spelling and case inconsistencies in severity categories  
- Standardized agent names to prevent duplicates  
- Verified missing values — none found (dataset 100% complete)

## 📈 Analytical Insights
| Insight | Observation | Impact |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| ⏱ Average Resolution Time | **4.5 days** overall | Stable but not improving year over year |
| 😊 Satisfaction Rate | **4.1 / 5** | Dips during high workload months |
| 🧰 Category Performance | Hardware (7.6 days) and System (6.6 days) slowest | Major bottlenecks |
| 👨‍💻 Agent Performance | 6 underperformers identified (high resolution time, low CSAT) | Need focused training |
| 📆 Ticket Volume Trend | Steady growth, peaks Aug–Dec | Seasonal workload pressure |
| ⚙️ Tool Efficiency | New software shows minimal improvement | Reconfiguration needed |

---

## 💡 Key Recommendations
- **Upskill underperforming agents** through structured training and mentoring  
- **Automate repetitive requests** (e.g., login resets, simple software installs)  
- **Implement AI-driven ticket routing** to auto-prioritize critical issues  
- **Deploy seasonal or contract staff** during high-volume months (Aug–Dec)  
- **Reconfigure ticketing software** to align severity and priority automatically

## 📊 Dashboard Snapshot

![Dashboard Overview](/images/dashboard_overview.png)

> The dashboard visualizes monthly ticket volumes, resolution times, satisfaction scores, and agent-level performance metrics.  
> It provides quick insights into workload distribution, seasonal patterns, and efficiency trends.

---

## 🔍 Summary of Findings
- The IT team’s **resolution speed has plateaued** (~4.5 days).  
- **Satisfaction remains steady** but shows dips during heavy workloads.  
- **Hardware and System categories** are major contributors to delays.  
- **Targeted training** and **better triaging tools** can significantly improve outcomes.  
- **Automation + Data Intelligence** will enable faster responses and scalable service delivery.

---

## 🚀 Business Impact
This analysis provides the IT management team with:
- A **data-backed strategy** to optimize workforce utilization  
- Actionable insights to improve **service quality and satisfaction**  
- Clear KPIs for **performance evaluation and decision-making**  

---

## 🧭 Future Enhancements
- Develop a **Power BI / Tableau dashboard** for live tracking  
- Use **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** for automated analytics and trend forecasting  
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict ticket resolution times based on issue type and severity
